At school, <name> realized their backpack was missing.
They checked the <place>, the cafeteria, and even asked the janitorâ€™s <animal>.
Inside the backpack was their favorite <object> and a box of <food>.
While searching, they bumped into a <mythical creature> carrying the exact same backpack!
The creature smiled and handed it back.
<name> thanked them and promised to never leave their backpack near the <place> again.
What a strange school day it had been.
