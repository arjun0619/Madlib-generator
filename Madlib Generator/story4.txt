Late at night, <name> was sitting quietly at <place> when they heard a soft noise.
Peeking outside, they saw a <animal> carrying a basket full of <food>.
The <animal> dropped the basket and ran off.
Inside it was a small note and a strange-looking <object>.
Just then, a glowing <mythical creature> appeared in the doorway, looking right at <name>.
It nodded once, then vanished.
<name> wasnâ€™t sure what had just happened, but they kept the <object> close.
